# Outdoor Navigation for people with Visual Impairments!

Everything you know about Outdoor Navigation is set to change.

From hyperloops to self-driving cars, from ride-hailing to micro-mobility, from multimodal travel to flying taxis, we are in the process of completely reinventing how people move. And while we do know that everything is about to change, we still need to figure out how.

This makes Outdoor Navigation one of the most exciting area in technology today. When you don't know what the future looks like, you have the power to invent it!
